 *This is a small program that have various encryption algorithms implemented.
 *Users should be presented with the option to specificy the name of a text file to 
 *encrypt and then choose an encryption method, and to then have a new file generated
 *that is an encrpyted version of the origional. 
 *I guess it would also be able to apply the decryption of a file using 
 *a specified algorithm.
