1. Steganography is a method of security through obscurity. It is sending data without any encryption, instead sending it disguised as something uninteresting. The difference between this and encryption is that an encrypted message is a message send as a message with techniques done to make it readable only to authorized parties, where as in steganography is not sent with encryption but rather it is thinly veiled behind innocuous data. Thus the steganographed data relies on undetection, and encrypted data relies on strong enough encryption methods. Digital watermarking is a method of steganography where data is embedded in a signal to make the new information added part of the original data. Hidden watermarking can be used for authentication of data or to send messages.
